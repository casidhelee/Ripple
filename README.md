Ripple
======

A simple, pretty rippling effect built in Processing.

This was a fun weekend project as an introduction to UI programming and Processing.  The inspiration came from the motion of a ripple through water.  I captured that essential motion using a sleek, flat design.

The main `draw()` loop is implemented in `Ripple.pde`.  I recommend you start reading code there.

Each circle in the animation is an instance of `Responder`, implemented in `Responder.pde`.

`Time_Utils.pde` contains utility functions for counting time.
